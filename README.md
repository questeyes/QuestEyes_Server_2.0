# QuestEyes Server v2.0+
## QuestEyes Server, recreated with Avalonia
### Note: this software is in the process of being rewritten.

This software works in conjunction with the QuestEyes hardware system to track users gaze within a VR environment.
It connects to the QuestEyes device and reads camera information, performs Over-The-Air updates on the device, and calculates and transmits eye position data over OSC to other applications to be interpreted in app.
